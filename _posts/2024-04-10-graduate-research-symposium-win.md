I am honored to have been selected as the **Winner of the Spring 2024 Graduate Research Symposium** at Mississippi State University. This recognition was awarded for my research presentation on _“Microwave Radiometer Calibration Using Deep Learning with Reduced Reference Information and 2-D Spectral Features.”_

The symposium celebrated outstanding graduate research across disciplines, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my work and represent our research group.

This recognition motivates me to continue contributing impactful work in the fields of signal processing and remote sensing.
