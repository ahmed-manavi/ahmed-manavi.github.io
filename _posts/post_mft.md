Selected for NC State’s competitive Mentored Teaching Fellowship (MTF) for Fall 2025, I co-taught ECE 301: Linear Systems under the guidance of Dr. Ali Cafer Gurbuz. This experience involved curriculum development, project design, interactive lecture delivery, and individualized student support—enhancing both my teaching skills and pedagogical insight.
