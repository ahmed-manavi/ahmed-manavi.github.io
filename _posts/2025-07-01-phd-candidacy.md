I’m thrilled to announce that I have officially advanced to **Ph.D. Candidacy** at **NC State University**!

Successfully completing my preliminary exam marks a major milestone in my doctoral journey, and I’m deeply grateful to my committee for their guidance and support.

**Committee Chairs and Members:**
- Dr. Ali Gurbuz *(Advisor)*
- Dr. Ismail Guvenc
- Dr. Vijay Shah
- Dr. Yuchen Liu

I look forward to continuing research in **spectrum coexistence**, **radar signal processing**, and **machine learning for remote sensing**—and contributing to the broader research community.

Thank you to everyone who’s supported me along the way!
