As my 6-month **Co-Op in Audio Machine Learning and DSP Research** at **Bose Corporation** comes to an end, Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for an experience filled with growth, collaboration, and innovation.

Over this period, I had the privilege of working with a **cross-functional, highly talented team** on cutting-edge projects blending acoustics, signal processing, and machine learningâ€”delivering promising results with potential impact in **spatial audio** and **listening zone-based EQ**.

### Highlights
- Collaborated closely with researchers and engineers across disciplines.
- Attended **AES Show 2024** and **SANE 2024 â€“ Speech and Audio in the Northeast**, gaining new insights and connecting with leading experts.
- Advanced research combining **acoustics**, **ML**, and **DSP** to push the boundaries of immersive sound.

### Gratitude
Special thanks to my manager **Miriam Israelowitz** and **Shuo Zhang** for their mentorship, guidance, and constant encouragement. Iâ€™m also deeply appreciative of the **Audio Systems Research group** and **Bose R&D** for fostering a collaborative and inspiring environment.

This journey has strengthened my passion for **audio technology** and reaffirmed my commitment to contributing to the field.  
Hereâ€™s to the next chapter! ðŸš€
