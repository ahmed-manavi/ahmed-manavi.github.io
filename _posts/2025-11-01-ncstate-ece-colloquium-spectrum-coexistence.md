I will be presenting an invited talk at the **NC State ECE Colloquium** in **November 2025**, titled:

> **“Spectrum Coexistence Between Active Technologies and Passive Sensors”**

This presentation will focus on the growing challenge of **radio-frequency interference (RFI)** in passive remote sensing systems, and emerging methods to ensure spectrum sharing. I will also discuss results from our custom testbed and the application of deep learning–based solutions such as **RFI-Net**.

I'm honored to share our group's research and contribute to the broader discussion on enabling robust and interference-aware sensing technologies.
