I’m excited to share that I’ve transferred to **North Carolina State University** to continue my Ph.D. studies in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of **Dr. Ali Cafer Gurbuz**.

This transition marks an exciting new phase in my academic journey, offering the opportunity to further explore cutting-edge research in **wireless sensing**, **signal processing**, and **spectrum coexistence**.

Looking forward to collaborating with a vibrant research community and contributing to impactful work in this new environment.
