This testbed enables controlled experimental studies of **spectrum coexistence** between passive sensors and active wireless systems. Built around an **L-band radiometer** and **5G signal emulation**, it facilitates end-to-end evaluation of **radio-frequency interference (RFI)** detection and mitigation strategies in a realistic shared spectrum environment.

Key features of the testbed include:

- Modular integration of radiometer and SDR-based 5G transmitter
- Configurable signal types, bandwidths, and power levels
- Radiometric Brightness Temperature retrieval for various scenarios
- Support for field deployment and data collection

This infrastructure has supported multiple publications, datasets, and real-world validations of deep learning-based RFI detection algorithms like **RFI-Net**, providing insights into the impact of 5G on passive sensing and approaches for resilient coexistence.
