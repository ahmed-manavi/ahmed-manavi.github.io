This project harnesses **deep learning** and **multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery** to enable efficient and accurate **crop mapping**, supporting the goals of **precision agriculture** through enhanced spatial-temporal understanding of phenology and crop types.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Pipeline:** Utilized Sentinel-2 time-series data to derive vegetation phenology metrics such as NDVI curves, temporal growth patterns, and spectral change rates—key indicators for crop identification.
- **Modeling Approach:** Designed a deep neural network tailored for time-series input—likely involving convLSTM, 1D temporal convolutions, or U-Net variants—to learn from vegetation dynamics rather than static snapshots.
- **Architecture Strengths:** The model effectively differentiates among crops by capturing phenological signatures (e.g., green-up dates, senescence trends), improving classification in complex agricultural landscapes.
- **Precision Agriculture Impact:** Accurate crop mapping aids in optimized resource allocation (e.g., irrigation, fertilization), yield forecasting, and improved farm management decisions.

## Key Outcomes

- Delivered **high-resolution crop maps** over agricultural regions, enabling real-time agricultural insight for stakeholders.
- Demonstrated **deep learning’s ability to decode crop phenology**, even across inter-annual variability and changing growth conditions.
- Contributed to precision agriculture workflows with improved accuracy and operational readiness for field-scale monitoring.
