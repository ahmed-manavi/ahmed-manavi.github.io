This project presents the design, development, and deployment of a **dual-polarized L-band microwave radiometer** built on a **software-defined radio (SDR)** architecture for operation on **small unmanned aerial systems (UAS)**. The system enables flexible, cost-effective, and high-quality passive microwave remote sensing for applications such as soil moisture monitoring, vegetation studies, and cryospheric observations.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Polarization Capability:** Measures both horizontal (H) and vertical (V) brightness temperatures for improved geophysical parameter retrieval.
- **SDR Architecture:** Allows reconfigurable signal processing, firmware updates, and flexible bandwidth control without hardware redesign.
- **Compact & Lightweight:** Optimized for small UAS payload limits while maintaining radiometric sensitivity.
- **Frequency Band:** Operates in the protected **L-band** (~1.4 GHz) for soil moisture and ocean salinity measurements.

## Methodology

The SDR-based radiometer architecture includes:
- **Front-End Module:** Low-noise amplifiers, bandpass filters, and polarization switching network.
- **SDR Back-End:** High-speed digitization, digital downconversion, and onboard FPGA-based signal processing.
- **Calibration System:** Internal noise diode and hot/cold reference loads for real-time radiometric calibration.

## Evaluation

- **Flight Campaigns:** Demonstrated from multi-rotor UAS platforms over agricultural fields and coastal zones.
- **Performance:** Achieved brightness temperature measurement precision comparable to larger airborne radiometers.
- **Advantages:** Lower cost, greater deployment flexibility, and rapid reconfiguration for mission-specific needs.

## Impact

This work highlights the potential of **small-UAS-borne SDR radiometers** to complement satellite missions by providing higher spatial resolution, targeted coverage, and rapid response measurements for environmental monitoring.
