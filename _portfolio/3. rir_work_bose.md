This project focuses on **estimating room dimensions** (length, width, height) from **Room Impulse Responses (RIR)** using a combination of **analytical methods** and **deep learning models**. The work was conducted during a Co-Op at Bose Corporation, blending acoustics, signal processing, and machine learning.

## Key Features

- **Analytical Approach:** Implemented methods to estimate room boundaries using inverse Sabine formula and validated with real-world RIR datasets.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Designed a multi-loss function neural network (MSE + L1 losses) with ~1.26M parameters for accurate dimension regression.
- **Data Sources:** Used simulated RIRs (PyroomAcoustics, MATLAB, in-house simulators) and the *BUT Speech@FIT Reverb* database for real-world validation.
- **Data Augmentation:** Added noise, altered absorption coefficients, and varied room dimensions and microphone/speaker placements to improve generalization.

## Methodology

1. **Simulation & Real-World Data** – Generated diverse room scenarios and processed real RIR recordings.  
2. **Feature Extraction** – Utilized multi-scale 1D convolutional layers to capture acoustic signatures related to room size.  
3. **Normalization** – Each RIR is normalized between (0,1) for consistent training.  
4. **Cross-Validation** – Trained on 3 rooms, validated on 1, tested on 1 for unbiased performance assessment.  

## Performance

- **Dimension Prediction:** Achieved high accuracy in estimating room size for both simulated and real data.  
- **Robustness:** Maintained performance despite noise injection and acoustic variability.  
- **Scalability:** Framework adaptable to different datasets and room types.  

## Impact

This work advances **room acoustics and audio-based spatial inference**, enabling applications in:
- Audio scene analysis  
- Virtual/augmented reality  
- Smart speaker calibration  
- Architectural acoustics design  

**Keywords:** Room Acoustics, RIR, Audio Machine Learning, Room Geometry Estimation
