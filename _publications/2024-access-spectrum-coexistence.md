This paper introduces a physical testbed and accompanying open dataset to support reproducible research in spectrum coexistence between passive sensing (e.g., satellite remote sensing) and active wireless communication systems. The system allows researchers to evaluate interference scenarios, RFI mitigation, and machine learning algorithms in a controlled environment.

The dataset includes synchronized measurements from both passive and active channels, and has been made publicly available to foster collaboration and benchmarking in the remote sensing and wireless communication communities.
