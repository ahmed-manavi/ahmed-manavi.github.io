I am experienced in developing advanced digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for audio applications, with a focus on room acoustics, room impulse response modeling, and room virtualization solutions. My work directly supports immersive and spatial audio innovations, including listening zone-based equalization (EQ) and enhanced room acoustic simulations. I am skilled in Python, MATLAB, and Bash, with a specialization in deep neural networks (DNN) using TensorFlow and PyTorch. I have experience with audio data preprocessing, large-scale automated data collection in an anechoic chamber for spectrum coexistence, and digital back-end development for hardware devices. My background includes interdisciplinary collaborations to drive end-to-end solutions for Earth observation and satellite systems, focusing on interference detection for passive sensing systems, sensor calibration, high-resolution spectrogram generation, robust direction-of-arrival estimation, and human activity recognition from sensor data.
